Data for linear corrections in the secondary spin q*s of the fluxes and amplitudes. All data is formated as association.
q=\mu/M is the asymmetric mass ratio, s the dimensionless secondary spin.  |s|=1 when the test body is an extremal Kerr BH. 

"SMRfluxdataWithSecondarySpin2025_36x36.m" contains the small spin corrections to the fluxes at infinity (key "chi2inf") and horizon (key "chi2inf"). The adiabatic flux data is provided by  Maarten van de Meent.

The remain files contain the adiabatic amplitudes (keys "A0spinlm") and the linear in spin corrections to the amplitudes (keys "A1spinlm"). For instance

"SMR_l2_amplitudedataWithSecondarySpin2025_36x36.m" stores amplitudes for l = 2 and all positive m modes. The key "A0spi22" loads the adiabatic amplitudes for the 22 modes, while "A1spin22" load the spin correction for the same mode.
 
<-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
IMPORTAT NOTE: all amplitudes now follow the convention of the BHPToolkit, specifically of the "Teukolsky" package. This convention is different from the one adopted in the folder "Lin_corr_fluxes_secondary_spin_fixed_freq" and "Lin_corr_fluxes_secondary_spin_fixed_radius". 
The spin corrections to the amplitudes stored here differ by a minus respect to the data in "Lin_corr_fluxes_secondary_spin_fixed_freq" and "Lin_corr_fluxes_secondary_spin_fixed_radius".

The 1PA  corrections in the spin were computed in the fixed frequency scheme: the orbital radius r is shifted by the small body spin in such a way that the coordinate-time frequencies of the spinning body are the same of the referential geodesics. In other words, the azimuthal frequency shift due to the secondary spin \delta \Omega_\phi, vanishes, i.e \delta \Omega_\phi = 0. 
All data are for spins-aligned, circular equatorial orbits, computed in a Chebyshev grid. The grid used for the data shown here is better designed than the grid used in the folder "Lin_corr_fluxes_secondary_spin_fixed_freq"

Convention used: a>0 (a<0) denotes prograde (retrograde) orbits, while  the z-component of the angular momentum is L_z>0 and aligned to z-axis centered on the primary. Thus, the coordinate time azimuthal frequency \Omega_\phi is always positive.

Truncation error sum over l, worst case (highest value primary spin prograde orbits, strong field) 
- 5.2 10^(-8) for adiabatic fluxes
- 5.0 10^(-6) for secondary spin corrections to the fluxes
